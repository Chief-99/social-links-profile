## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about semantic HTML. That is one of the main things I have been learning when doing these projects. I also learnt how that you should nest two interactive elements inside each other (I had initially put a `<a>` element inside a `<button>`). 

### Continued development

As mentioned above, I want to keep learning how to properly implement the use of semantic HTML. I also want to keep learning more best practices when it comes to HTML and CSS, as I am still pretty new at this. That is why I am very grateful for this Frontend Mentor community.
